## Brief:

The performance dashboard is somewhat undeveloped. We would like to offer a more polished Greenspace Performance Dashboard which could include:
- A refined Improvement Dashboard with editable text and graphs
- Graphs drawn from data points within Greenspace e.g % compliance with legislation
-  Report generation and ability to data-stamp and archive them.
### Also consider:
- Ability to upload and present data eg Net Zero commitments, energy, waste etc
- And other ideas to showcase our client's improvements and plans that the students may have!

## How to use the Repo

Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/WestheadJ/group12/issues), create an issue, choose the template. If it's a new feature, you click on the feature template, create it and then you go to the development section and click create branch. This will copy the existing code but won't change the main branch <img width="288" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-28 at 4 42 46 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57768613/221919768-c3eddf55-1208-48f0-a177-30f03d94e771.png">

After you have comittied everything to that branch submit a pull request, this will compare the changes, make sure it's comparing your branch to the main. Once submitted we can then all check the code and how it looks, you should be able to look and run anyone's branch if you switch to it,this can be done easily in github desktop. If it's a genral update on how the code works, just commit straight to the main branch. Make sure commit titles make sense and give a dscription if it's a big change.
